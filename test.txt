This method of data sampling is very useful for the data economy, giving researchers the ability to narrow down to a direct sample from a wider pool of data. This is similar to methods used in academia, where entirely random sampling is taken from a pool of research, otherwise known as stratified random sampling or probability sampling. Random sampling has many key attributes, including its simplicity and ability to provide a succinct and accurate representation of a wider data pool.
